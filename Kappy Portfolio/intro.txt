This course represents the third stage of The Brock Blueprint: Personal
Branding with a Purpose, a multi-year curriculum initiative in the Brock
School of Business. The Brock Blueprint is designed to help you build a
strong, purpose-driven personal brand across multiple courses, preparing
you to communicate your value effectively and cultivate authentic
professional relationships grounded in stewardship, service, and
integrity.

In the Digital Marketing Portfolio, you will advance the personal brand
foundations developed in earlier courses (Business Communication and
Principles of Marketing) by applying them in a real-world digital
marketing context. Here, the focus shifts from explaining who you are to
showing what you can do. Your digital marketing portfolio will serve as
tangible proof of your skills in web design, SEO, analytics, branding,
and content strategy while also communicating your professional value to
potential employers and clients.

The Digital Marketing Portfolio project is structured in three
integrated stages, each building on the last:

1.  Content Creation (Stage 1 – 17%): Develop and design your portfolio
    website, applying digital marketing principles to communicate your
    personal brand effectively.

2.  Publication & Analytics (Stage 2 – 3%): Launch your site and set up
    analytics tools to track audience behavior and key performance
    metrics.

3.  Performance Evaluation (Stage 3 – 5%): Analyze your portfolio’s
    performance data and use those insights to make evidence-based
    recommendations for future improvements.

    By the end of this project, you’ll demonstrate your ability to
    strategically manage a digital presence, measure marketing
    effectiveness, and translate data into actionable decisions — all
    essential skills for today’s marketers.

How do you build a personal brand online?

Whether or not you’ve ever Googled yourself, you can be sure that
potential employers and clients will. That’s why managing your online
reputation is a crucial step in shaping how others perceive you.

Start by opening an incognito browser window and searching your name.
Ask yourself:

- What shows up first — and is it professional?

- Are there things you’d rather hide or remove?

- Are there important things missing that should appear more
  prominently?

  This quick audit gives you a baseline for improving your online
  presence. Some starting points:

- Clean up your digital footprint—Make personal accounts private or
  deactivate them. Delete content that doesn’t align with your
  professional image.

- Leverage SEO to your advantage—Upload professional photos and tag them
  with your name — Google is likely to prioritize them in search
  results.

- Set up a Google Alert for your name to monitor new mentions and manage
  your reputation proactively. To create alerts, go to
  www.google.com/alerts.

What is a Digital Marketing Portfolio?

A digital marketing portfolio is your professional showcase — a website
that highlights your skills, tells your story, and demonstrates your
ability to plan, design, and execute marketing strategies. It’s not just
a résumé; it’s a living, evolving representation of your brand and
expertise.

Through your portfolio, you’ll:

- Introduce yourself and share your background.

- Display your best work and key projects.

- Demonstrate your skills in digital content creation, SEO, analytics,
  design, and more.

- Communicate your personality and professional identity in a way that
  makes you memorable.

What hosting platform do I use for my Digital Marketing Portfolio? 

You can choose any web-hosting platform that fits your long-term goals.
Adobe Portfolio is the industry standard but requires a subscription.
Wix is a highly recommended free option and my personal favorite. Others
such as WordPress, Weebly, or Squarespace are also acceptable.

Requirements:

- Your site must be publicly accessible (no password required).

- It must allow you to connect Google Analytics or use a built-in
  analytics dashboard.

- Free trials must remain active for the duration of the course.

- Do not use Google Sites.

  Custom domain names are not required but encouraged — they make your
  site look more polished and professional.

Set up of my hosting platform for my Digital Marketing Portfolio is complete, now what? 

Before you begin building your site, take time to plan strategically.
Follow these steps:

1.  Define your objectives. How will this portfolio help you reach your
    professional goals? Think of 1–2 specific outcomes you want to
    achieve.

2.  Seek inspiration. Explore at least 3–5 example portfolios to spark
    ideas.

3.  Choose a template. Select one that reflects your personal brand and
    goals.

4.  Outline your site structure. Sketch a sitemap showing pages,
    headings, and navigation flow. Aim for 3–5 pages total — concise,
    focused sites are most effective.

5.  Plan your content. Consider which images, writing, design elements,
    and work examples best communicate your story and skills.
