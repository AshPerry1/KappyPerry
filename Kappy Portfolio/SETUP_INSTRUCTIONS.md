# Setup Instructions for Kappy Perry's Portfolio

## Quick Start

Your portfolio website is ready to go! Here's what you need to customize before submitting:

## 1. Update Personal Information

### index.html (Homepage)
- Line 43: Update the intro paragraph with your actual background
- Line 50-51: Replace image placeholder with your professional headshot
- Lines 68-70: Adjust educational details if needed
- Line 86: Personalize the "Bug" nickname section to match your actual story

### contact.html

- Line 90: Update LinkedIn profile URL to your real LinkedIn profile
- Line 98: Add your phone number (or remove this line if you prefer not to share)
- Lines 106: Update location if needed

## 2. Add Your Images

Replace all image placeholders with your actual photos:

**For index.html:**
- Professional headshot (hero section)
- Consider adding a personal photo in the "Personal Touches" section

**For work-samples.html:**
- Screenshot or badge for Google Analytics certification
- Screenshot or badge for Digital Marketing certification  
- Screenshot from marketing simulation
- Campaign screenshots/results for class projects
- Email campaign results/images

To add images:
1. Save images in a folder called `images/`
2. Replace the `<div class="image-placeholder">` with: `<img src="images/your-image.jpg" alt="Descriptive alt text">`
3. Make sure alt text describes what the image shows

Example:
```html
<img src="images/google-analytics-badge.jpg" alt="Google Analytics Individual Qualification certification badge">
```

## 3. Update Work Samples Content

### work-samples.html

For each project, update:
- Project titles (currently placeholder)
- Dates and meta information
- Your actual role and contributions
- Real results with concrete numbers
- Add any additional projects you have

**Required Elements:**
- 2 Industry Certifications (already have placeholders)
- 1 Marketing Simulation (already have placeholder)
- Additional class projects (adjust content to match your actual work)

## 4. Contact Form Setup

The form currently uses client-side validation and will show a success message when submitted. For it to actually send emails, you have two options:

### Option A: Use Formspree (Recommended)
1. Go to https://formspree.io
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new form
4. Copy your form action URL
5. In `index.html` find the `<form id="contactForm">` and add:
   `action="your-formspree-url"` and `method="POST"`

### Option B: Leave as-is for class submission
- The form will show a success message
- Include a note in your submission that email sending requires backend setup
- Or provide a mailto: link as an alternative

## 5. Resume Download Link

Update the "Download RÃ©sumÃ©" button:
- In `index.html` line 45, change `href="#"` to:
- `href="resume.pdf"` (after you add your resume PDF to the folder)
