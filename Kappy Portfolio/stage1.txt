Digital Marketing Portfolio Stage 1: Content Creation (170 points)

This project is the first stage of your Digital Marketing Portfolio — a
website designed to showcase your skills, communicate your personal
brand, and demonstrate your ability to apply digital marketing strategy
in a real-world context. In this stage, you’ll build the foundation of
your site and create high-quality content that reflects who you are as a
marketer.

Your goal is to design a portfolio that is both strategic, searchable,
and visually appealing. You’ll integrate what we’ve learned about SEO,
web design, analytics, and content strategy into every part of your
site.

Project Requirements

1.  Visual Identity

From a branding perspective, it is important to create a consistent
visual identity. Please read each of the linked resources in the section
below as you prepare the following areas of your visual identity:

a.  Color palette - research the psychology of color which suggests that
    different hues can impact human behavior and perceptions
    differently. Your color selection should reflect and align with your
    visual identity goals.

b.  Layout - Text content should be formatted thoughtfully using
    bullets, pull quotes, and headers as appropriate.

c.  Fonts - Fonts are also an integral part of the design process - the
    fonts we use also have the power to influence feelings, thoughts,
    and even behavior.

d.  High-quality photos - This can be a headshot or a lifestyle picture
    depending on your goals, but the picture should look professional.
    Logos and other images can also be included/incorporated throughout
    (when necessary). Be sure images are cropped appropriately and not
    pixelated.

e.  Tone and voice - Research and strategically implement throughout.
    For help with developing your writing style, check out Mailchimp’s
    Style Guide. Although this level of detail is not necessary for this
    assignment, you should consider your tone and voice. How do you want
    your portfolio to appear to your viewers? Professionalism does not
    mean boring!

Remember that it is important to keep these items consistent across all
media platforms to develop and maintain a consistent visual identity
which can also increase your personal brand recognition.

2.  Web Design & User Experience (UX)

Design is about more than aesthetics. It’s also about functionality.
Your website should feel intuitive, accessible, and engaging to users
while meeting professional standards of usability.

a.  Navigation - Menus should be clear, concise, and logically
    structured. Visitors should be able to easily find key pages within
    two clicks.

b.  Accessibility - Follow ADA accessibility guidelines (scroll almost
    to the end to the “How Can I Make my Website ADA-Compliant"
    section). Include descriptive alt text for all images, ensure strong
    color contrast, and use descriptive button labels (e.g., “Contact
    Me” instead of “Click Here”). It is recommended that you use a
    website accessibility checker prior to publication.

c.  Responsive Design - Your site must display and function properly on
    desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

d.  Call to Action - Include at least one prominent, clear CTA (e.g.,
    “Contact Me,” “Download My Resume,” “View My Work”) to encourage
    engagement.

e.  Error free content - The portfolio should be error free. Be sure to
    check for spelling and grammar mistakes.

Think like a user. If someone landed on your site for the first time,
could they instantly understand who you are, what you offer, and how to
connect with you?

3.  SEO Strategy & Integration

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is how people find your portfolio
online — and how you signal relevance and credibility to both users and
search engines. In this section, you’ll apply the core SEO principles
we’ve covered in class to make your site more discoverable, strategic,
and aligned with your personal brand.

Your portfolio must include the following components on every page:

a.  Title Tags (3–8 words): The clickable headline that appears in
    search results and browser tabs. Each page should have a unique,
    descriptive title tag that reflects the page’s purpose and includes
    your target keyword(s). For example, instead of “About,” use
    something more optimized like “About Jane Smith – Digital Marketing
    Strategist.”

b.  Meta Descriptions (120–160 characters): The short summary shown
    below the title tag in search results. Write clear, compelling
    descriptions that incorporate relevant keywords naturally and
    encourage users to click. For example: “Jane Smith is a digital
    marketing strategist specializing in social media strategy, content
    marketing, and SEO-driven brand growth.”

c.  Alt Text for All Images: Every image on your site should include
    alternative (alt) text describing what’s shown. Alt text improves
    accessibility for screen readers and gives search engines more
    context about your content. Keep descriptions concise and relevant.
    For example, “Screenshot of Google Analytics dashboard showing 40%
    audience growth.”

d.  Headers (H1 and H2) Optimized for Keywords: Use your headings not
    just for structure but also for SEO. Each page should have one main
    H1 tag that clearly signals what the page is about, and supporting
    H2 tags that include secondary or related keywords. For instance,
    your H1 might be “Social Media Marketing Case Studies,” and your H2
    could be “Content Campaign Performance Metrics.”

e.  Internal Linking: Include at least one internal link on each page
    that connects to another relevant page on your site. Internal links
    help visitors navigate your content more easily and help search
    engines understand the structure and hierarchy of your site. For
    example, on your “About” page, you might link to your “Work Samples”
    page with text like, “See examples of my campaigns here.”

Approach this section as if you were optimizing a client website. Search
engines reward clarity, consistency, and relevance — so focus on writing
for both people and algorithms.

4.  “About” Page

This is often the first page viewers will see (homepage). Use it to tell
your story and position your value.

a.  Introduction: Create a compelling homepage that hooks visitors.

b.  Show your skills & strengths. Think about what your value and
    competitive advantage is in the marketplace. Who are you? What makes
    you unique? What value do you bring?

c.  Provide Professional background & credentials.

d.  Display your personality (e.g., hobbies, strengths, pets, a few
    details, etc.). Try to keep a good balance of professional versus
    personal.

5.  Contact Information

Make it easy for people to reach you.

a.  Provide email address. Do not list home address.

b.  Include a contact form that routes to your email.

c.  Included LinkedIn (required) and other social media accounts when
    relevant.

    i.  Be sure your LinkedIn profile is up-to-date. Check out this
        resource for recommendations on how to polish your LinkedIn
        profile.

d.  Additional optional information to include – phone number, city, and
    state.

6.  Work Samples

Oftentimes, future employers or potential clients in this field want to
see what type of work you are capable of doing. Therefore, this section
of the portfolio gives you the chance to showcase your work accordingly.

a.  Select Projects - Choose the best and most relevant work that aligns
    with your career objective(s). I suggest the following:

    i.  Class projects related to your career objectives.

    ii. Previous work experience.

    iii. Industry Certifications (2 required for MARK 460)

    iv. Simulation Experiences (required for MARK 460)

    v.  Other information may include a service page (if you offer any
        type of service), blog, vlog, email campaigns, digital ad
        campaign, etc.

b.  Display Assets: For each section, be sure to include an image (e.g.,
    example from the campaign or analytic results), write a description
    of your role with the project, and give a description of the
    results. Give concrete numbers as often as possible. Be concise.

Notes about Copyright & Ethics

Any photos, images, or music used should include proper attribution. If
you do not have an attribution, provide a brief explanation of when you
(or someone you know) created the content or how you obtained permission
to use it. If you are in a photo, you don’t have to explain.

Any use of content not created by yourself must be clearly cited and
credited.
